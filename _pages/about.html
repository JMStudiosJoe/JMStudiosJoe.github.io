Come along on a journey through wondrous discovery of light. Joseph is on a lifelong journey to capture and convey moments of light and shadow, and let the viewer experience their own short story through his paintings. Through Joseph’s passion for learning, he grows from every painting, drawing, and moment he is brought towards light on his journey to becoming a master painter.

Joseph’s paintings are metaphoric stories that stir with the viewer into their own short story through light. He brings the Hudson River Valley school of art style of light, with intimate paintings influenced by Ivan Shishkin. Gazing upon Josephs’ original paintings, through his brushstrokes and paint application, the viewer will experience a conversation with Joseph, on what story they were brought into, whether it be a memory, a moment, or just a feeling, and truly change the way the viewer views art.
